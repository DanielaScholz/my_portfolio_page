            <p>I am a Frontend developer based in Vienna, Austria. I enjoy bringing designs into real life and find great joy in continuous development. 
                I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web
                developer position. If you think Iâ€™d be a good match for your projects, contact me!</p>
